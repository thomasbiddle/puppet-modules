This project consists of the Puppet modules that are in use on my server (Which hosts ThomasBiddle.com, ThomasBiddle.co, ThomasBiddle.info, & VPSInfinity.com)

I am using <a href="https://github.com/rodjek/librarian-puppet">Librarian-Puppet</a> to keep track of installed modules and ensure consistency.
